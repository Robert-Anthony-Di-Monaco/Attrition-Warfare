ANNOUNCEMENTS HERE: 

Terrain is just a trial one, I'll change it, I know the navmesh doesnt work 100%. I will fix it. 
We still need models for basic soldier types, I found one on unity but I need to upgrade to 5.2.2 to use it. 
There's this program called Mixamo which is currently on free preview. It makes creating characters + animations very simple. 
Ill fool around with it and see if I can use it to get all the specific animations we need.
